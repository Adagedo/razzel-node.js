## Idea behind the example
This shows how to setup [Preact](https://github.com/developit/preact) with Razzle.

Here is a list of changes from Razzle's base template:

  1. Install `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx` as a devDependency.
  2. Extend Razzle's babel config with a custom `.babelrc`
  3. Install `preact` and `preact-render-to-string`
  4. Remove `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom` entirely
  5. Update `server.js` to use `preact-render-to-string`'s `render` function. Also remove the `<div id="root">` element from our html template since Preact can render to the body.
