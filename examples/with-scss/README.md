## Idea behind the example

This is a basic, bare-bones example of how to use razzle. It satisfies the entry points and use scss as styling language
You can import anything from node_modules or other scss files, like Bootstrap, etc.
`src/index.js` for the server, `src/client.js` for the browser, and `src/App.scss` for SCSS style.
