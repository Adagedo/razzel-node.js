## Idea behind the example
This shows how to use [Inferno](https://github.com/infernojs) instead of React in a Razzle project.

Here is a list of changes from Razzle's base template:
  1. Install `babel-plugin-inferno` as a devDependency.
  2. Extend Razzle's babel config with a custom `.babelrc`
  3. Install `inferno`, `inferno-server`, `inferno-devtools`, `inferno-component` as dependencies
  4. Remove `react`, `react-dom`, `react-router-dom` entirely
  5. Update `server/server.js` to use `inferno-server`'s `renderToString` function.
  6. Update `client.js` to configure Inferno for HMR.
